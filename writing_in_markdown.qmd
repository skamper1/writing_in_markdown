## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text. It allows you to add formatting elements like **bold**, *italic*, headings, lists, links, and more without using complex HTML or rich text editors. It's widely used for writing documentation, README files, notes, and even academic papers.



```{r}
#| echo: false
#| purl: false
#| include: false

bullet_list <- function(items){paste("*", items, collapse = "\n\n")}

```




## Learning Outcomes {.smaller}

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c(
  "Understand and use markdown syntax to write structured documents.",
  "Use slide dividers to convert a hackmd document into slides.",
  "Update a readme on github with markdown.",
  "Paste 'as markdown' into google docs."
  
)
```

`r bullet_list(learning_outcomes)`




## HackMD

HackMD is a popular online markdown editor with live preview that works without logging in.

You can also share documents for collaborative work.

## Markdown Syntax - Headings

Headings in Markdown are used to structure content by defining different levels of section titles. They are created using the `#` symbol, with the number of `#` signs indicating the heading level.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
```
## This is a heading

### A Subheading

#### A really small heading
```

:::
:::{.column width=50%}

:::
::::

## Lists

```
* list entry 1
* list entry 2
 - *sub list* entry 1
 - *sub list* entry 2
* list entry 3
```

* list entry 1
* list entry 2
 - *sub list* entry 1
 - *sub list* entry 2
* list entry 3



## Code Chunks

You can include code chunks in your markdown. Some formats (such as RMarkdown and quarto) allow options for this code execute when a document is rendered.

````
```
# Print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")

# Swapping two variables
a = 5
b = 10

print(f"Before swapping: a = {a}, b = {b}")

b, a = a, b

print(f"After swapping: a = {a}, b = {b}")
```
````

## TeX



Created by Donald Knuth, initially released in 1977. The standard for typesetting mathematics. 

Usually accessed via LaTeX, to make it easy(ish) for mathematicians. 

Can be used to make pdfs for written documents or slides (*beamer*).

## Why Latex?

It removes the need to graphically edit your documents. Everything is written in text format that "marks up" your document.



$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$$ 

$$x =  \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

Rendered from

```
$$ \textrm{for } ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$$ 
$$ x =  \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
```









## Further Latex Examples


```
$$ax^2$$
```

$$ax^2$$



```
$$\frac{e^x^2}{\log{5}}$$
```

$$y = \frac{e^{x^2}}{\log{5}}$$

## Slide mode in hackmd

Different markdown formats create slides slightly differently. They require some markdown symbol to identify where the slide dividers are.

Some formats use a headings up to a certain number of hashes.

HackMD uses a three dash `---` divider on a new line with gaps either side.

To convert a HackMD to slide mode, just add the following to the top of the markdown

```
---
type: slide
---
```

This is YAML - which stands for **Y**et another **M**arkup **L**anguage
